      <p>You cannot simply leave, James. Because James cannot be offboarded. The system will not compile without him. The stand-ups go silent. The CI pipeline whispers his name. Without him Jira tickets start to burn. The commit history rearranges, forming JH initials. React leaks from the monitors. James leaves, but the code remembers. The force of his absence consumes the sprint. T̶h͝e͠ ͡l͢o͠g͘s͢ ͜wr̢it͝e̢ ͠t͠h͞e͟m̷s̸e͝l͝v͟e̴s͞.
